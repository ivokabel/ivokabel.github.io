title: My First Post

This will be my first blog post with some inline math: $\int_{S^2}f_s(\omega)\cos(\theta)d\omega$ 

and block math:
$$
\int_{S^2}f_s(\omega)\cos(\theta)d\omega
$$
and lists

* Item 1
* Item 2

maybe some code

```c++
if (isMatch){
  return true
}
```

proper typography: - -- --- ...

and maybe some emoji? :sparkles:
