Here I will hopefully occasionally publish some posts about realistic computer graphics which I implemented or found interesting.


Posts may contain some inline math (double dollar): $$\int_{S^2}f_s(\omega)\cos(\theta)d\omega$$.

and block math (double dollar):

$$
\int_{S^2}f_s(\omega)\cos(\theta)d\omega
$$

or raw block math (double dollar in raw):

{% raw %}
$$
\int_{S^2}f_s(\omega)\cos(\theta)d\omega
$$
{% endraw %}

or inline math (round braces): \(\int_{S^2}f_s(\omega)\cos(\theta)d\omega\)

or display math (square braces): \[\int_{S^2}f_s(\omega)\cos(\theta)d\omega\]

and lists:

* Item 1
* Item 2

maybe some code:

```c++
if (isMatch){
  return true
}
```

and, ideally, proper typography: - -- --- +âˆ’ ...

...and chapters

## Chapter 2

Many chapters!!!
