Here I will hopefully occasionally publish some posts about realistic computer graphics which I implemented or found interesting.



Posts should contain some inline math: $\int_{S^2}f_s(\omega)\cos(\theta)d\omega$ or maybe $$\int_{S^2}f_s(\omega)\cos(\theta)d\omega$$

and block math:

$$
\int_{S^2}f_s(\omega)\cos(\theta)d\omega
$$

and lists:

* Item 1
* Item 2

maybe some code

```c++
if (isMatch){
  return true
}
```

proper typography: - -- --- +âˆ’ ...

## Chapter 1

...and chapters

## Chapter 2

Many chapters!!!
